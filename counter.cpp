    //2- the formula to increment or subtract
    //3- buttons one to increase the counter value and the other to decrease the counter value

    // we have the counter value and we want to add one to it, this will be done by executing the formula to increment, how and when will this formula/function be executed?
    //how? find a way to make the computer read keyboard input, if it reads arrow up, execute increment formula else if it reads arrow down execute decremet formula/function
